# Facebook Share

This gem will add an easy-to-use Facebook Share button feature to your Rails project. This gem does not take care of authentication or authorization. It's only purpose is to bind Facebook Share button to anything you want.

Any public method will return just JavaScript code and nothing else.

## How To Install

This gem relies on jQuery, be sure to have it installed in your project. It does not depend on jquery-rails gem, because some projects use jQuery without it.

    gem install facebook_share

## Code changes

If you don't have a Facebook Application for your project yet, [create one](http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php).

Then add this to your ApplicationHelper

    module ApplicationHelper
      include FacebookShare

      FacebookShare.default_facebook_share_options = {
        :app_id => "YOUR_APP_ID",
        :status => false,
        :cookie => false,
        :xfbml => false,

        :selector => '.fb_share',
        :locale => "en_US"
      }
    end

You can ommit *app_id* parameter, if you already have a Facebook Application initialized in your project.

Be sure you have <div id="fb-root"></div> in your application layout before you load the Facebook Connect JS

Default facebook Share options can be changed with the above code snippet
* *appid* - your Facebook application ID that will connect your site to Facebook.
* *status*. *cookie* and *xfbml* - as described at [FB.init JS SDK](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/fb.init/)

* *locale* - Facebook locale code representations, ie. en_US, de_DE, pl_PL, etc. The full list of Facebook supported languages is available in http://www.facebook.com/translations/FacebookLocales.xml or at [Facebook Developer Wiki](http://fbdevwiki.com/wiki/Locales)
